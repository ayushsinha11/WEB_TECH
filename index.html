    <h1>ISE CLUB</h1>
    <h2 id="Description"> Description
        <p>Getting involved in an extracurricular club could be one of the highlights of your time on campus. Whether you’re a head-of-the-class, perfect-GPA, volunteers-at-the-nursing-home-on-weekends kind of student, or a stay-out-late-on-Thursday, avoid-taking-classes-on-Friday-morning, in-it-for-the-personal-growth type of student, there’s an activity out there for you. And in many cases, that club could plug you into a national network of like-minded groups, individuals, and possibly even future employers.

            On the subject of getting a job, employers today take a holistic view of potential employees. You’ll need to bring more to the table than just academic excellence. Employers hire students who truly made the most of their college career. And just to be clear, being crowned your dorm’s beer pong champ doesn’t count, even if it does impress your friends.
            
            What does count is getting involved! Whatever your interests, most campuses have a matching club or group. Generally speaking, groups and clubs fit into one of several categories:
            
            Academic Clubs
            Political Clubs
            Media & Publication Groups
            Community Service & Social Justice
            Theater & The Arts
            Cultural Clubs
            Religious & Spiritual Groups
            Sports & Recreation</p>
